      Fatma impressed me with her creativity, leadership and cooperation with her colleagues.
      She designs creative teaching aids and presents her lessons in innovative way.
      Besides, she has an obvious sense of leadership.
      As a person, she has a sense of humor and a cheerful spirit that
      gives positive energy to people around.
      I strongly recommend having Fatma as an English teacher in your school.
      She is a passionate and talented teacher and a person who spreads positive energy
      to others.

      Fatma impressed me with her enthusiasm and her creativity.
      She is always willing to accept the different opinions of her colleagues
      and she always impressed them with her personality.
      When we open the discussion I always wait for her in particular to speak
      because she is always has something impressive to add.
